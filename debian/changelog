phoebetria (1.3.0-1) stable; urgency=low
   * This is a major feature release and is a direct result of the solid
     framework built into the previous releases. Weâ€™ve included a new preference
     panel that allows you to set some basic environment settings, name fans and
     temperatures, set startup and shutdown profiles and use custom themes. If
     you know how to write custom stylesheets for the web then creating your own
     custom themes will be familiar. The RPM indicators have been modified to
     move with the current rpm until they reach their target RPM. The RPM sliders
     now use a logarithmic scale instead of the previous linear scale; this can
     be toggled in preferences. Software auto has been tweaked to operate more
     smoothly and reliably, and finally the usual bug fixes.
