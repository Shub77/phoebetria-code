Version 1.2.0
====================
It took some time but we feel Phoebetria finally matured to a non-beta
status.  There are two significant changes packed into this release, the
first of which is software auto.  This feature takes the Recon's auto
mode a step further by allowing you to setup your own fan curves and 
unlocks the fans so that they can be controlled by any temperature probe.
The second feature has to do with the way your profiles are saved.  We've
moved away from .ini files to a SQLite database for greater flexibility.
The first time you launch this version your old profiles will be imported 
automatically.

Other changes include:

  Cleaning up the GUI to maximize space and make it more intuitive.  While
in manual mode clicking the RPM button opens a window for an alternative
way to set the RPM. Clicking the channel icon will change the Recon's
display to show that channels settings.


Version 1.1.1 (Beta)
====================
Although this is a "point release" many changes and improvements have 
been incorporated. Behind the scenes the code is more efficient. These 
efficiency gains mean that, from a user perspective, the GUI is more 
responsive and many bugs have been fixed. The GUI has been polished and 
now the controls and window properly resize themselves depending on user 
settings and the user environment. Additionally, when setting a manual 
RPM using the RPM sliders, the sliders now 'lock' to the user-defined 
RPM; if the reported RPM is not equivalent to the manual RPM an 
indicator below the slider changes to yellow. Minimise to tray has been 
implemented and user profiles have been improved. 

This release is also a milestone. From this point onward we will be 
adding features to Phoebetria that the OEM software does not provide.
