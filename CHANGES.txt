                                CHANGE LOG


Version 1.1.1 (Beta)
====================
Although this is a "point release" many changes and improvements have 
been incorporated. Behind the scenes the code is more efficient. These 
efficiency gains mean that, from a user perspective, the GUI is more 
responsive and many bugs have been fixed. The GUI has been polished and 
now the controls and window properly resize themselves depending on user 
settings and the user environment. Additionally, when setting a manual 
RPM using the RPM sliders, the sliders now 'lock' to the user-defined 
RPM; if the reported RPM is not equivalent to the manual RPM an 
indicator below the slider changes to yellow. Minimise to tray has been 
implemented and user profiles have been improved. 

This release is also a milestone. From this point onward we will be 
adding features to Phoebetria that the OEM software does not provide.
